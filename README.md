# SMP2023
The repository describes the models we used in SMP2023 Challenge.

The quickest way to reproduce our model is to run the **./HeyFea-main/test_k_fold_model.py** using the checkpoints in **./HeyFea-main/save_model/**. We used the pesudo-labels technique to get these checkpoints.
If you want to reproduce the our model from scratch, please follow the steps blow.

Firstly, re-pretrain the roberta models using the script: wait to be updated.

Next, extract the features using pretrained models: Wait to be updated

Finally, use all the features to do the prediction.
