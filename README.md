# SMP2022
The method we used in SMP2022 Challenge
The quickest way to reproduce our model is to run the **./HeyFea-main/test_k_fold_model.py** using the checkpoints in **./HeyFea-main/save_model/**. We used the pesudo-labels technique to get these checkpoints.
If you want to reproduce the our model from scratch, please follow the steps blow.
